#INTERMEDIA_01_01	The Great Desert of Gerat. An ancient kingdom ruled over this land long ago... until it was torn apart by strife and internecine war. The last king of Gerat swore allegiance to the Romani Empire.
#INTERMEDIA_01_02	This land seems to be doomed to bear the burden of war for all time. Seven years ago an imperial official, the Lord Governor of Khiva, overthrew the king and declared a rebellion against the Emperor’s rule.
#INTERMEDIA_01_03	And now our turn has come. We have come to Gerat to end this once and for all.

#INTERMEDIA_02_01	On the morning of the sixth day, the observation station reported a large vessel approaching from the south. All our forces were put on high alert.
#INTERMEDIA_02_02	It was a lone ship, approaching slowly and showing no signs of aggression. Hope began to spread among the officers — perhaps it was one of Skobelev’s vessels. But when it got close enough, we recognized it: the Imperial cruiser Sevastopol.
#INTERMEDIA_02_03	It was staggeringly gigantic — a veritable flying mountain. We assembled an honor guard and prepared to meet the crew.
#INTERMEDIA_02_04	But, to our astonishment, the first man to step down the ramp was a tall Elaim wearing a golden mask. Behind him was an endless crowd of people with terrible burns and gruesome wounds, all of them Romani from the capital. It was from them that we finally heard the terrible news.
#INTERMEDIA_02_05	The capital of the Empire had suffered a nuclear strike four days ago. Sayadi Stronghold burned down in an instant, reduced to a smoldering desert of radioactive waste. What remained of the Imperial Fleet was in a disarray, trying desperately to fight off the Gathering’s advancing forces.
#INTERMEDIA_02_06	We were at a loss for words. We didn’t know what to do. Most of us wanted to head for the capital and join the battle, knowing that the war was already as good as lost.

#INTERMEDIA_03_01	I was awakened in my cabin by a messenger. “Admiral, sir! The Grand Duke has asked you to come to the bridge.” Something was wrong with the ship.
#INTERMEDIA_03_02	The crewmen in the wheelhouse looked distressed and confused, their eyes vacant and lost in thought. And yet he was completely calm — a stark contrast to the rest of the room that I found oddly fascinating.
#INTERMEDIA_03_03	But when I looked out the porthole, I saw the reason for their alarm. According to the clock, the sun should have been rising, but the world behind the glass was pitch black. The ships’ searchlights were weaving around frantically, scouring heaven and earth in a vain attempt to slice apart the all-consuming darkness with their narrow beams of manmade light.

#AFTERSHOCK_1	<NPC=PETR><SIDE=-1><SHADOW=1><SCR=CONTINUE>Gentlemen, I have assembled you here to discuss our future activities in light of the most recent events.
#AFTERSHOCK_2	<NPC=PETR><SIDE=-1><SCR=CONTINUE>My opinion is this: we must press on and continue our advance towards {glossary=Khiva,GLOSS_KHIVA}.
#AFTERSHOCK_3	<NPC=DAUD><SIDE=1><SCR=CONTINUE>Pyotr Ignatyevich, the news from the capital has rendered this entire operation moot. We must return to the motherland at once — the sooner, the better.
#AFTERSHOCK_4	<NPC=PETR><SIDE=-1><SCR=CONTINUE>On the contrary! Taking {glossary=Khiva,GLOSS_KHIVA} is more important than ever. If you would allow me to elucidate...
#AFTERSHOCK_5	<NPC=PETR><SIDE=-1><SCR=CONTINUE>I’ve had several lengthy conversations with the crew of the Sevastopol. It pains me to say this, but I’m convinced that the war in the south is lost. Returning to the motherland will spell certain doom for us.
#AFTERSHOCK_6	<NPC=PETR><SIDE=-1><NOSPEAK><SCR=CONTINUE>We all had similar suspicions. Now that those fears had been put into words, many of the officers averted their gaze.
#AFTERSHOCK_7	<NPC=DAUD><SIDE=1><SCR=CONTINUE>Then what do you propose, Pyotr? (There was exhaustion in Daud’s voice.)
#AFTERSHOCK_8	<NPC=PETR><SIDE=-1><SCR=CONTINUE>The rebel fleet is currently engaged in heavy combat in the south. Now is the time to mount an offensive in the north and take {glossary=Khiva,GLOSS_KHIVA} by force.
#AFTERSHOCK_9	<NPC=DAUD><SIDE=1><SCR=CONTINUE>And what comes next? We'll just delay the inevitable. Sooner or later they will come to {glossary=Khiva,GLOSS_KHIVA}.
#AFTERSHOCK_10	<NPC=PETR><SIDE=-1><SCR=CONTINUE>I have reason to believe that our intel on the reactor is accurate. If we can seize it, they won’t fight back. They will come to the bargaining table to ensure that the reactor is intact.
#AFTERSHOCK_11	<NPC=PETR><SIDE=-1><SCR=CONTINUE>Perhaps we might be able to strike a deal.
#AFTERSHOCK_12	<NPC=PETR><SIDE=-1><NOSPEAK><SCR=CONTINUE>Pyotr looked around as the officers considered his words.
#AFTERSHOCK_13	<NPC=DAUD><SIDE=1><SCR=CONTINUE>We have to send a vessel to reestablish communications with the capital. Once we have a reliable line to the south…
#AFTERSHOCK_14	<NPC=PETR><SIDE=-1><SCR=CONTINUE>There’s no time for that, {glossary=Sharif Rahmatovich,GLOSS_DAUD}. If we do not mount an assault on {glossary=Khiva,GLOSS_KHIVA} here and now, it will be too late.
#AFTERSHOCK_15	<SCR=CONTINUE>We spent the rest of the night and the entire following day discussing Pyotr’s plan.
#AFTERSHOCK_16	<SCR=CONTINUE>Eventually we agreed to send the cruiser Diana to the south in a bid to reestablish communications with the Empire. The rest of our forces hastily began preparations to reach {glossary=Khiva,GLOSS_KHIVA} and assault it.
#AFTERSHOCK_17	<SCR=CONTINUE>The Sevastopol became the flagship of the new squadron.
#AFTERSHOCK_18	<SCR=CONTINUE>At some point an officer asked who would command the offensive. Pyotr readily replied with a plan of his own.
#AFTERSHOCK_19	<NPC=PETR><SIDE=0><NOSPEAK><SCR=CONTINUE>He stood up and spoke with confidence. “No one yet knows what has befallen the Emperor,” he said. “So the Grand Duke, the sole legitimate heir of the dynasty, must lead what remains of the {glossary=Romani,GLOSS_ROMANI} Fleet in this offensive.”
#AFTERSHOCK_20	<NPC=DAUD><SIDE=0><NOSPEAK><SCR=CONTINUE>Admiral {glossary=Daud,GLOSS_DAUD} balked at the idea, but his furious cries of protest were ignored. The officers eagerly supported the general’s suggestion. The thought of the heir to the throne leading the charge himself did wonders for their morale.

#DIALOG_END_HINT	Success! You can end this conversation now.

#SHIP_DESC_INTREPID	The Intrepid is a tried-and-true artillery corvette, a cornerstone of the Romani Fleet. Her excellent balance between armor and mobility combined with excellent artillery capabilities and an affordable price make the Intrepid one of the best choices for establishing airborne dominance.
#SHIP_DESC_LIGHTNING	A unique light interceptor armed with rapid-fire 100mm artillery guns. Many green Academy graduates have been assigned to a craft such as this and perished along with dozens of their peers. In the hands of a skilled pilot, however, the Lightning can work wonders.
#SHIP_DESC_SKYLARK	A light tanker retrofitted to carry EIS equipment, she’s a simple, but quite useful ship. Her incredible range and excellent speed make her equally useful as a long-range reconnaissance unit and a tanker for a small task group.
#SHIP_DESC_YARS	A tactical missile carrier, her reliable, sturdy armor can protect her priceless payload from a close-range nuclear explosion. Just standing next to this vessel can make one rather uneasy.
#SHIP_DESC_ROOK	A diminutive corvette envisioned as a dedicated bomber by a particularly bright mind at Command, this one-trick pony is only good for releasing explosive payloads over targets at low altitudes. For what it’s worth, however, she’s well suited to the job and has secured a place in the Fleet.
#SHIP_DESC_NAVARIN	A mainstay of the Fleet, as old as time, the Navarin is beloved by officers for her versatility and adored by pilots for her reliability. She can handle anything - new artillery guns, new engines, even more equipment - without breaking a sweat. It’s no wonder this ship remains in service after decades of use.
#SHIP_DESC_FENEK	The doyens of Gerat may detest these small Romani anti-air defense ships for being too expensive and difficult to maintain, but they were built for a great war.
#SHIP_DESC_TRIUMPHANT	A long range anti-air ship that is utterly impossible to find in Gerat. Use her wisely - she was designed for important work.
#SHIP_DESC_GLADIATOR	Hailing from the newest frigate line of the Romani Fleet, this vessel is a true powerhouse in combat. Extreme caution is advised when engaging these vessels in a dogfight.
#SHIP_DESC_LONGBOW	One of a plethora of ships built to provide air support to faraway outposts, these vessels now make up half of all Gerati aircraft carriers. When all is said and done, this plane-carrying frigate combines an affordable price with well-balanced specs.
#SHIP_DESC_FLOWER	A missile corvette with a dated design refurbished by Fleet engineers. In spite of all her upgrades, she still lacks top speed and firepower. The six missiles she carries are still enough to make a sizable dent in a battlecruiser, but once they’re gone, it would be wise to retreat.
#SHIP_DESC_KORMORAN	The Cormoran and her sister the Negev are the two main light cruisers in the Romani Fleet. They can operate entirely on their own or provide tactical integrity as the core unit of an airborne group.
#SHIP_DESC_WANDERER	The Wanderer! We survived many an adventure with this old girl! This quintessential expeditionary frigate of the Romani Fleet was designed specifically to cross the boundless expanses of Elaat. She’s a reliable vessel that carries enough fuel for the long haul and enough armaments to fend off sky pirates if need be.

<ANS=Did you kill this man? Why?>

#MEETING_1	<BACKGROUND=empty_night><MUSIC=Bois><SCR=CONTINUE|MEETING_1_OLD>As you approach, you spot the lord governor’s massive cruiser looming over the dark valley where it touched down. You give the order to land a hundred meters away.



#HELLO_END_YES_GOVERNOR_01	
#HELLO_END_NO_GOVERNOR_01	I understand, Duke. Enough words.
#HELLO_END_ANS_GOVERNOR	I would like to invite you to join my cause, my lord.

#HELLO_RES_LIKE_GOVERNOR	<NPC=HIRE><APPROVE>Very well. I will join you, Duke.<ANS=Then come with me. We have much to discuss.|EXIT|DIPDIALOG_WIN>
#HELLO_RES_LIKE2_GOVERNOR	<NPC=HIRE><APPROVE>No. I won’t be involved in this game of yours.<ANS=I am very sorry to hear that.|MEETING_FIGHT>
#HELLO_RES_DESLIKE_GOVERNOR	<NPC=HIRE><APPROVE>No, Duke.<ANS=I am very sorry to hear that.|MEETING_FIGHT>
#HELLO_RES_UNFEAR_GOVERNOR	<NPC=HIRE><APPROVE>Nay. Never.<ANS=I am very sorry to hear that.|MEETING_FIGHT>

#SHIP_DESC_GEPARD	A powerful state-of-the-art anti-air ship, it sports enough heavy artillery and sturdy armor to survive even against lighter, faster vessels. Do not get too complacent, however — this vehicle is far too expensive to be sacrificed in a dogfight.
#SHIP_DESC_SEVASTOPOL	The flagship model in the Romani heavy cruiser range, envisioned as the core of a large strike group. With unparalleled standalone cruising capacity and the best armaments in the Imperial Fleet, this vessel is formidable even on its own.@10The cruiser was sent into battle as soon as it was built, so it is still missing many of the non-vital systems it was designed to carry.

#SHIP_DESC_NOMAD	Romani heavy strategic cruisers, which have been serving as a core of command groups for decades. Despite their age, they have undergone an extensive amount of upgrades and participated in field tests of the state-of-the-art AEW systems, which were planned to be installed later on the newest Sevastopol-class cruisers under construction.



#NIGHTFEAR_SPEECH_REACTOR_1	<SCR=CHECK_JOINED|DAUD|EXIT><NPC=DAUD><SIDE=-1>Do you truly think the Khiva reactor is an ancient shelter of some sort, Duke?
<ANS=I am certain of it, Admiral|NIGHTFEAR_SPEECH_REACTOR_2>
<ANS=Without sunlight, an operational nuclear reactor represents our only chance at survival.|NIGHTFEAR_SPEECH_REACTOR_2>
#NIGHTFEAR_SPEECH_REACTOR_2	<NPC=DAUD><SIDE=-1><SCR=CONTINUE>Shakhor Al-Farakh, “the Day of the Black Void...”
#NIGHTFEAR_SPEECH_REACTOR_3	<NPC=DAUD><SIDE=-1><SCR=CONTINUE>You know, Duke, with the sun gone, even the air is bound to grow too cold. It will eventually freeze.
#NIGHTFEAR_SPEECH_REACTOR_4	<NPC=DAUD><SIDE=-1>All the air in the atmosphere will condense into a crust on the surface of the planet. How do you plan to survive in a vacuum, my Duke?
<ANS=I have been told that the Khiva reactor is as large as a mountain. Our knowledge and skill pale before those of our ancestors. We need to trust them.|EXIT>



#ENDRACE_SPEECH_5	<NPC=PETR>An assault on the city will be quite impossible, then.
<ANS=Surely you’ve noticed that it’s getting colder every day?|ENDRACE_SPEECH_6>
#ENDRACE_SPEECH_6	<NPC=PETR><SCR=CONTINUE>I have more than noticed, my Duke.
#ENDRACE_SPEECH_7	<NPC=PETR><SCR=CONTINUE>I check the thermometers every morning… (Pyotr trails off.) I mean, every day at six o’clock.
#ENDRACE_SPEECH_8	<NPC=PETR><SCR=CONTINUE>Either way, if this continues…
#ENDRACE_SPEECH_9	<NPC=PETR><NOSPEAK><SCR=CONTINUE>Pyotr sighs deeply, then shakes his head, at a loss for words.
#ENDRACE_SPEECH_10	<NPC=PETR><SCR=STOP>I’ll be honest, my Duke — I still can’t make heads or tails of any of this.


#REACTOR_CAPTURED_1	<EVENT>The Khiva reactor was taken and obliterated by the forces of the Gathering.<SCR=CONTINUE>
#REACTOR_CAPTURED_2	<EVENT>The people of Gerat have lost all hope of surviving this calamity.<SCR=STOP>

#TOTAL_WAR_INFO	{max=520}{font=dinpro_48_black}{align=2}TOTAL WAR@10{font=fixed_20}{align=0}Money means nothing now. Fuel, ammunition, and repairs are free of charge.@10In light of the calamity, many people in Gerat will seek to join your cause.<SCR=STOP>

#TUTORIAL_RAM_1	<NPC=PETR><SIDE=-1>There are rumors, Grand Duke... they say you ordered one of our vessels to ram an enemy ship. The vessel’s entire crew perished as a result.
<ANS=Those rumors are completely unfounded, General.|TUTORIAL_RAM_YES>
<ANS=What of it? Those brave men and women will be posthumously promoted and celebrated as heroes of the Empire.|TUTORIAL_RAM_NO_1>
#TUTORIAL_RAM_YES	<NPC=PETR><SCR=STOP>Be that as it may, these rumors are highly detrimental to morale.
#TUTORIAL_RAM_NO_1	<NPC=PETR><SCR=CONTINUE>If you keep giving these kinds of orders, the men will lose all faith in victory.
#TUTORIAL_RAM_NO_2	<NPC=PETR><SCR=CONTINUE>Our people do not have a death wish, Mark.
#TUTORIAL_RAM_NO_3	<NPC=PETR><PETR=-1><SCR=STOP>Good day.
